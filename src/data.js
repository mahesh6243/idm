Since there were no medical institutions in the erstwhile state of Mysore a scheme for giving Medical education was started in 1881 under which carefully selected students were given scholarship and sent to places like Madras and Bombay to undergo training only to return and work as Hospital Assistants.After the Madras Presidency expressed its inability to admit Mysore State students, the Government of Mysore sanctioned another scheme in April 1917 as a part of which a Mysore Medical School was started at Bangalore to train the then called Sub Assistant Surgeons. Trainees had to undergo a course for 4 years to qualify as a Licensed Medical Practitioner (LMP). In 1924 the Mysore Medical School was upgraded and was now called the Mysore Medical College. The college was affiliated to the University of Mysore and the trainees were now granted Medical Degrees. Mysore Medical College was the first medical college in the state of Mysore and only the seventh in the whole country at this time.",

        "The K.L.E. Society’s Law College at Bangalore has been conceived as a nursery and training ground for those seeking to enter the legal profession. Under the umbrella of Karnataka Lingayat Education Society, the college was established in 1975 to cater to the needs of young students desirous of pursuing legal education in Bangalore. To start with, a three Year LL.B. Degree Course was introduced and in the year 1996, a five year Integrated Degree Course in B.A. LL.B. was introduced to attract young students to commit at their earlier age to a Professional Course. To cater to the needs of the globalised corporate world and prospective corporate lawyers, another Five Year Integrated Course – B.B.A. LL.B. was introduced in the academic year 2011-12. While many successful students of the college from its inception have occupied top positions in the society in various fields like advocacy (trial and appellate), corporate practice, chamber practice, management, government offices, etc., in the recent years most of the students have occupied pivotal positions in many corporate enterprises too.",
